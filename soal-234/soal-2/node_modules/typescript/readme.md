## Lirik Lagu Manipulation Script

This repository contains a JavaScript script for manipulating song lyrics data. The script demonstrates how to update the artist and song title in a song lyrics object.

## Overview

The script starts with an object containing information about a song, including the artist, song title, and lyrics. It then creates a new object that updates the artist and song title while keeping the original lyrics intact.

## Script Explanation

1. **Initial Data**: The script initializes an object `lirik_lagu` that holds information about a song by the artist Avenged Sevenfold, titled "Little Piece of Heaven". This object includes the song lyrics both as a single string and an array of strings.

2. **Updating Data**: The script then creates a new object `updated_lirik_lagu` by copying the original `lirik_lagu` object and modifying the `artist` and `songTitle` fields in the `data` property.

3. **Output**: The updated object is logged to the console.
